Binary Strings without Adjacent 1s

Max Score: 100

Find the number of binary strings of length N, such that there are no adjacent 1s in that string.



Input Format

The first line of input contains T - number of test cases. It is followed by T lines, each line contains N - length of the binary string.



Output Format

For each test case, print the number of binary strings of length N, separated by new line. Since the answer can be very large, print answer % 1000000007 [1e9+7].



Constraints

1 <= T <= 105

1 <= N <= 105

Explanation



Example 1:

You can construct the following binary strings of length 3 with no adjacent 1s:

000, 001, 010, 100, 101






def binaryst(n):
    result=[0,2,3]
    for i in range(3,n+1):
        result.append((result[i-1]+result[i-2])%1000000007)
    return result
result=binaryst(10**5)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(result[int(input())])
